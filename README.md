# WebdriverIO workshop

This project was created with the purpose of teaching people how to use WebdriverIO.

There are four setups ready to be used but they are mainly there for reference, here's a small overview of what each setup showcases:

`e2e-wdio-cucumber-typescript` - cucumber with typescript and a easy to use debugging setup (both normal and though vscode)
`e2e-wdio-jasmine` - a simple setup that showcases the use of jasmine
`e2e-wdio-mocha` - mocha with some assignments that teach you the basics of WebdriverIO
`e2e-wdio-standalone` - showcases the use of webdriverio without the testrunner, should only be used for things other then e2e testing, for example things like webscraping

## Development server

Run `npm start` or `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

First start a dev server to test against and make sure you have a working internet connection for tests that do not use the example site.
Change your directory to one of the setups that have already been created for you called either `e2e-wdio-cucumber-typescript|e2e-wdio-jasmine|e2e-wdio-mocha`.
Run `npm test` to execute the end-to-end tests via [WebdriverIO](http://www.webdriver.io/).
